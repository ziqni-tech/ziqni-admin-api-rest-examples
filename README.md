Gamification done right for your business and customers.

Ziqni Admin Api Services are used to manage your [Ziqni](https://www.ziqni.com) project, tournaments servers, missions, achievements and all other features offered by the platform.

This project provides scripts which can be directly imported inside [Postman REST Client](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/) to start experimenting with our APIs.

Please import both json files, environment and collection inside Postman. 

Once you have successfully imported both files, configure the client id to be used for JWT token.

Navigate to the collection, select the environment, get the access token and execute various REST methods.

In case, of any issues, please drop us an email at: support@ziqni.com
